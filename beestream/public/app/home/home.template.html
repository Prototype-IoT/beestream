    Sorry for the mess!  Everything should work, but we're not done designing
    everything yet!  Look for changes over the next few weeks!

  <h1>What is Beemon?</h1>
  <p>
    The Beemon project began in 2012 to work to idenify the causes and signs of
    colony collapse disorder. Beemon, an abbreviation for Bee Monitoring,
    started with the goal of being a low-cost way to record video at the
    entrance of a honeybee hive. The project now includes video, audio, and
    temperature/humidity recordings at a honeybee hive all in a low-cost system.
    The project has also grown to include a number of analytics utilities that
    allow us to automatically count bee arrivals/departures at the honeybee hive,
    identify individual bees for analysis, and recognize oddities in audio files.
    With this information we hope to predict and eventually diagnose colony
    collapse disorder.
