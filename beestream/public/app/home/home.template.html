      Sorry for the mess!  Everything should work, but we're not done designing
      everything yet!  Look for changes over the next few weeks!

    <h1>What is Beemon?</h1>
    <p>
      The Beemon project began in 2012 to work to idenify the causes and signs of
      colony collapse disorder. Beemon, an abbreviation for Bee Monitoring,
      started with the goal of being a low-cost way to record video at the
      entrance of a honeybee hive. The project now includes video, audio, and
      temperature/humidity recordings at a honeybee hive all in a low-cost system.
      The project has also grown to include a number of analytics utilities that
      allow us to automatically count bee arrivals/departures at the honeybee hive,
      identify individual bees for analysis, and recognize oddities in audio files.
      With this information we hope to predict and eventually diagnose colony
      collapse disorder.
