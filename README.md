# beestream
A dynamic web application for streaming BeeMon videos!

## Status
This is a work in progress! 

## What is it?
Beestream is a streaming service for BeeMon videos!  Now you can check up on hives remotely without an ftp utility!  

Beestream aims to:
* Stream videos from today on demand
* Stream the newest video updated live all day
* Stream from multiple hives
* Interact with videos and study our data
* Keep up to date with your hives remotely

## What did you write it in?
The intent is to use the modern MEAN webstack for this streaming utility to make upkeep easy!  

This means we will use:
* MongoDB - NOSQL database if a database is needed
* ExpressJS - A NodeJS package to handle http servers and other serverside tasks
* AngularJS - A NodeJS web frontent package
* NodeJS - Basically the backend of all of this!  It's a JS instance based on the Chrome V8 Javascript Engine which allows you to add packages on the fly!

## When will it be done?
May 2018!

## Where will I find it in the end?
